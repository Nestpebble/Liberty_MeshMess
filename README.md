## Use Case
Maybe you bought some radio modules on a whim? Maybe you clicked the wrong thing on Aliexpress. Maybe you couldn't make up your mind whether you wanted 22db or 30db, and bought both. Maybe you just want to try *all the things*.

Most PCB makers will only sell you boards in multiples of 5. OSHPark will only sell in multiples of 3. Either way, if you only have one module, you've got some spares.

This board will allow you to try lots of different things.

It accepts a Pro-micro, or can be used as a Pi-hat. If you use the one with Ellis Pi-land at
